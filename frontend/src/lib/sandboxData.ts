export const FY_ARJUN_INSIGHTS: Record<string, string> = {
  FY01: 'The dot-com crash wiped out tech stocks globally. FD investors slept peacefully. But the recovery over FY02–03 rewarded those who stayed in equity.',
  FY02: 'A flat year after the dot-com crash. The worst was over, but fear kept most people out. Those who started SIPs here saw massive gains by FY05.',
  FY03: 'One of the best years ever for Indian markets. Recovery from the dot-com bottom. Investors who entered at the darkest moment were richly rewarded.',
  FY04: 'Election surprise caused a single-day 15% crash, then full recovery. A lesson: political events create noise, not trend changes.',
  FY05: 'Strong bull run. Every asset class performed well. Years like this make people overconfident. The next correction is always around the corner.',
  FY06: 'Near the peak of the 2003–2008 bull run. Spectacular returns, but unsustainable. Investors who joined here faced the 2008 crash within 2 years.',
  FY07: 'A moderate year. Nothing exciting, nothing scary. This is what a normal year looks like. Most years are like this, not the crashes or booms.',
  FY08: 'The setup year before the global financial crisis. Returns looked good, but the worst crash in decades was months away.',
  FY09: 'The worst year in recent history. Even FD outperformed equity. But FY10 recovered everything and more. Panic sellers locked in permanent losses.',
  FY10: 'The greatest recovery year in Indian market history. Those who stayed through FY09 saw +76%. This is why you never sell in a crash.',
  FY11: 'A steady year. Not exciting, but profitable. Consistent years like this compound quietly into wealth over decades.',
  FY12: 'A sideways to negative year. SIP investors bought more units at lower prices. This is when discipline matters most.',
  FY13: 'Gradual recovery. Markets slowly climbing out of the FY12 slump. Patience paying off for those who stayed.',
  FY14: 'The Modi rally. Markets surged on election optimism. A reminder that markets often price in hope before reality.',
  FY15: 'Strong continuation of the Modi rally. But year-end corrections reminded investors that trees don\'t grow to the sky.',
  FY16: 'China fears caused a global correction. India fell 8%. Those who pulled out missed the strong FY17 recovery.',
  FY17: 'Demonetisation in November 2016 caused short-term pain, especially for smallcaps. But markets recovered within months and ended the year strong.',
  FY18: 'A steady year. Good returns without drama. These are the years that quietly build wealth while everyone waits for the next big event.',
  FY19: 'Moderate returns. IL&FS crisis caused some nervousness but markets held up. A year that rewarded steady investors.',
  FY20: 'FD beat all equity funds this year on a 1-year basis. But investors who held equity through FY21 made far more. Context is everything.',
  FY21: 'Every asset class surged post-COVID. This was an exceptional year. Do not use FY21 as your baseline expectation.',
  FY22: 'A relatively average year. Nifty gave 22%. This is close to the long-run average. Steady, not spectacular.',
  FY23: 'A flat to slightly negative year. Global slowdown, rate hikes, and uncertainty. FD looked attractive. But one flat year doesn\'t change the 20-year story.',

export const FY_ARJUN_CONTEXT: Record<string, string> = {
  FY01: 'FY01 was the dot-com crash year. US tech stocks collapsed, dragging Indian IT with them. Nifty fell 16%. This was the first major crash many investors experienced. Fear was universal. FD investors felt vindicated. But the seeds of the greatest bull run in Indian history were planted in these ashes. FY03 delivered +72%.',
  FY02: 'FY01 aftermath. Markets were flat — Nifty fell just 3%. The dot-com fear lingered, keeping most retail investors away. 9/11 added to the terror. But this was the year to accumulate quietly. Those who started SIPs here captured the entire FY03–FY06 bull run. Patience was being tested. Patience won.',
  FY03: 'One of the greatest years in Indian market history. Nifty surged 72%. Smallcaps gained 115%. The dot-com crash was over. Stimulus, cheap valuations, and returning confidence drove a massive rally. Investors who had survived FY01 and FY02 were richly rewarded. This is what staying invested looks like.',
  FY04: 'The BJP election surprise caused a single-day 15% Nifty crash. Circuit breakers triggered. Then markets recovered completely within weeks. This year taught investors that political events create noise, not permanent damage. Growth was 11% by year-end. Steady, despite the drama.',
  FY05: 'A strong bull run year. Nifty +38%, midcaps +49%. Global liquidity flooding in. India was the darling of emerging markets. Foreign money poured into every segment. Returns looked easy. The danger of years like this: they make you think every year will be this good.',
  FY06: 'The peak of the 2003–2008 bull market. Nifty surged 67%. Smallcaps gained over 107%. Everyone was an investor. The euphoria was intoxicating. But markets that go up this fast always correct. The 2008 crash was brewing under the surface. Greed was in full control.',
  FY07: 'A quiet year. Nifty +12%. No big headlines, no panic, no euphoria. This is what most investing years actually look like. Boring, steady, and profitable. The compounding happens in years like this, when nobody is watching. A reminder that normal is good enough.',
  FY08: 'The last good year before the storm. Nifty +24%. Everything looked fine. The global financial system was already cracking at the seams, but markets hadn\'t noticed yet. Investors who joined here would face a -36% crash within 12 months. Timing teaches humility.',
  FY09: 'The Global Financial Crisis. Lehman Brothers collapsed. Credit markets froze worldwide. Nifty crashed 36%. Midcaps fell 47%. Smallcaps lost 58%. This was the worst year in a generation. Every headline screamed to sell everything. But FY10 gave +76% to those who stayed in.',
  FY10: 'The greatest recovery year in Indian market history. Nifty surged 76%. Smallcaps gained 122%. Global stimulus floods markets. Those who panicked in FY09 locked in permanent losses. Those who stayed — or bought more — saw generational wealth creation. This is the reward for courage.',
  FY11: 'A moderate year. Nifty +11%. After the FY10 euphoria, markets settled into normal territory. Returns were healthy but unremarkable. This is what sustainable investing looks like — steady gains that compound over decades without drama.',
  FY12: 'A testing year. Nifty fell 9%. European debt crisis weighed on global markets. India\'s growth slowed. SIP investors bought more units at lower prices — this is where discipline matters most. FY13 recovered with +8%, and the Modi rally followed.',
  FY13: 'Gradual recovery from the FY12 slump. Nifty +8%. Markets were slowly climbing back. Nothing exciting, nothing scary. This is the boring middle that separates patient investors from impatient ones. The Modi rally of FY14 was months away.',
  FY14: 'The Modi rally began. Nifty surged 18% on election optimism. A reminder that markets price in hope before reality. India\'s reform narrative attracted massive foreign investment. Every asset class performed well. Optimism was back after a difficult FY12.',
  FY15: 'Continuation of the Modi bull run. Nifty +28%. Multiple expansion drove returns as earnings growth lagged. Market breadth was excellent — even smallcaps gained 45%. But trees don\'t grow to the sky, and FY16 brought a -8% correction.',
  FY16: 'China devaluation fears triggered a global sell-off. Nifty fell 8%. Emerging markets were hit hard. India looked vulnerable. But this was a global sentiment shock, not an India problem. Markets recovered in FY17 with +19%. Panic sellers paid a permanent price.',
  FY17: 'Demonetisation in November 2016 caused short-term chaos. Smallcaps were hit hardest. But the economy adapted faster than expected. Nifty ended +19% for the year. The lesson: domestic policy shocks in India create temporary disruption, not structural damage.',
  FY18: 'A steady, unremarkable year. Nifty +11%. After demonetisation drama and the GST rollout, markets settled. Corporate earnings were recovering. This was a year of quiet compounding — no crashes, no euphoria, just the steady wealth-building that most investors miss.',
  FY19: 'The IL&FS crisis caused nervousness in credit markets. But equity markets held up — Nifty +15%. A divergence: debt investors faced real fear while equity investors had a decent year. Diversification across asset classes showed its value clearly.',
  FY20: 'COVID-19 pandemic. The worst single-month crash in Indian market history. Nifty fell 23% in March alone. Global lockdowns. Economic activity stopped. Fear was absolute. FD felt like the only safe choice. But FY21 delivered +70% to those who stayed invested through the panic.',
  FY21: 'The COVID recovery year. Nifty surged 70%. Smallcaps gained 113%. Global stimulus, vaccine optimism, and returning growth drove an extraordinary rally. This was the payoff for surviving FY20. Critical lesson: do not use this year as your baseline expectation. It was exceptional.',
  FY22: 'Post-COVID bull market, then Russia-Ukraine war in February 2022. Oil spiked. Inflation surged globally. Despite the chaos, Nifty still managed +15%. The market\'s ability to absorb geopolitical shocks surprised most observers. India\'s domestic story stayed strong.',
  FY23: 'A flat to negative year. Nifty -1%. Global rate hikes, recession fears, and the Adani short-seller report weighed on sentiment. FD was attractive at 7%+. But one flat year after a 70% rally isn\'t a problem — it\'s normal mean reversion.',
